# ZeroTypesHPP

Truly single file library version of the ZeroTypes drop-in library ZeroTypesSFL, based on the ZeroJSON variant.

Builds in MSVC2017 and beyond

Easily ported to Linux

Works with C++ 11 to C++ 17 and possibly 19, 20, 21, etc

This repo has less features than ZeroTypes, but it's all in one file for convenience, portability and minimal footprint.

Differences:
- More reliance on std::string in Zstring
- Certain non-core features removed
- Addition of a Cartesian class that handles 2D rectangles and can also perform complex collision detection
